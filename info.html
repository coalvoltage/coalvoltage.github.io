        <p>Currently as an undergraduate at the University of California, Riverside, I am pursuing a Batchelor's Degree in Electrical Engineering. I also am enrolled in the UCR Honors program, hoping to improve my abilities as a student and advance my career. In addition, I am a part of UCR's branch of the Institute of Electrical and Eletronical Engineers as an attendee of their general meetings and formed a team in their Micromouse competition.</p>
		<p>In my freetime, I enjoy playing indie video games and watching various anime shows. I also work on small projects ranging from custom levels for the popular Valve game, Team Fortress 2, to video game prototypes using Python.</p>
